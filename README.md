### Task

To develop an API which is able to do the below activities.

 1. Create a new cart for a Registered user/customer  `DONE`
     
        POST ​/api​/v1​/carts
 2. Create a cart entry for the cart of the user/customer `DONE`
    
        POST ​/api​/v1​/carts​/{cart-code}​/cart-entries
 
 3. View cart entry of the cart of the user/customer `DONE`
       
        GET ​/api​/v1​/carts​/{cart-code}​/cart-entries
 
#### TBD
 * Validation yet be implements
 * As per our discussion, not required to implements user/customer module
 * Unit test and Integration test yet be implements
 
#### Problem Identified with shared code

- [ ] Lot of code mix with database layer and (service+controller) layer
- [ ] The sampled code more difficult to maintenance and understanding code flow

#### Solution with shared your code
- [x] According the layer approach, controller should not talk to directly into database layer
  that means whenever write some service(API or endpoint), we have use DTO's(service+controller)
  and database layer both are individual model class
- [x] More linear approach and easy to maintenance 
- [x] The controller also we have created new separate class such as CartEntry and Cart
- [x] Use mapper either Mapper class or MapStruct Library

## Cloudfoundry

    ibmcloud login -a https://cloud.ibm.com -u passcode -p <passcode>
    ibmcloud target --cf
    ibmcloud cf push  -f cloudfoundry/manifest.yml  --vars-file cloudfoundry/dev-vars.yml
## Kubernetes
    
  At first time, application setup execute: 'kubectl-execute-dev.bat'
  
  This bat file having all configuration and apply the kubernetes cluster, this will step the such like <b>deployment,service,ingress,HPA,VPA and network policy</b>
   
<b>This application will be deploy kubernetes cluster via CI/CD pipleline</b>

##### Application Name:

     ms --->    means Microservice
     transactions --> Application Name
     Example: ms-cart
  

##### Application Scaling:

Scaling Horizontally:

Incoming requests to your application are automatically load balanced across all instances of your application, and each instance handles tasks in parallel with every other instance. 

    ibmcloud cf scale ms-cart -i 2

Scaling Vertically:

Vertically scaling an application changes the disk space limit or memory limit that Cloud Foundry applies to all instances of the application


-k DISK to change the disk space limit applied to all instances of your application

-m MEMORY must be an integer followed by either an M, for megabytes, or G, for gigabytes


    ibmcloud cf scale ms-cart -k 512M
    ibmcloud cf scale ms-cart -m 1G
    ibmcloud cf scale ms-cart -i 2
    
Show all apps:

        ibmcloud cf apps
        ibmcloud cf app ms-cart   
        ibmcloud cf logs ms-cart
        ibmcloud cf delete ms-cart
